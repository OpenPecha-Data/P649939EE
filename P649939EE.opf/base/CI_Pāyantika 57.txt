57. Should a male novice say: “As I understand the Dharma taught by the Blessed One, indulgences
in these which have been declared by the Blessed One to be obstructive conditions are
not sufficient for a hindrance”; that male novice should be 'spoken to thus by the monks:
“Do not, O Venerable male novice, speak thus: 'As I understand the Dharma taught by the Blessed
One. indulgences in these which have been declared by the Blessed One to be obstructive
conditions are not sufficient for a hindrance.' Do not speak [this] about the Blessed
One. False accusation against the Blessed One is not good, and also the Blessed One has not
said that. The obstructive conditions, O male novice, have been declared by the Blessed
One in many ways to really be obstructive, and indulgences [in them] are sufficient for a
hindrance. Abandon such an evil view, O male novice.” If that monk, being spoken to by the
monks, should abandon that course, this is good. If he should not abandon it, he should
be examined and instructed two or three times for the abandonment of that course. Being examined
and instructed two or three times, should he abandon that course, this is good. Ifhe
should not abandon it, that male novice should be spoken to thus by the monks: "From this
day on, O Venerable male novice, the Blessed One, the Tathāgata. the Arhant, the Fully Enlightened
One should not be mentioned as your teacher. You should not follow behind one or
another Brahmacarin, and as the other male novices obtain [the privilege of] sleeping in
the same house with the monks for up to two nights, from this day on. for you this is not
allowed. Go away, foolish man, you are expelled.” Whatever monk should knowingly treat kindly
or meet with a male novice who has been expelled, or should lie down in the same house
with that one, that is a pāyāntika.

75. Whatever monk, being spoken to [thus] by the monks: “This precept should be practiced by
the Venerable One”; should say: “I will not practice according to the words of you who are
foolish, stupid, and weak-minded; not until I shall ask monks who are masters of the Sūtras,
masters of the Vinaya, and masters of the Matrkas”; that is a pāyāntika. This precept
should be practiced by a monk desiring omniscience, [and also] monks who are masters of the
Sūtras, masters of the Vinaya, and masters of the Matrkas should be questioned. This is
the proper course in this matter.

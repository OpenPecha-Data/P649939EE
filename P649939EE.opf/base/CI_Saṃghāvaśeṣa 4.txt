4. Whatever monk, with impassioned mind, should recommend, in front of a woman, [sexual] service
with the body to himself, saying, “Sister, this is the highest of services; namely, that
one should serve with this act connected with sexual intercourse, a monk like me who is
well disciplined, virtuous and chaste”; that is a saṃghāvaśeṣa.

3. Whatever monk should, as premeditated, with his own hand, deprive a human or one that has
human form1 of his life, supply somebody with a knife [so he can kill himself], search for
an assassin to kill him, instigate him to die, or praise death, saying, “O man, what use
is this dreadful, impure, sinful life to you? O man, death is better than life for you”;
should [the monk] purposefully, being of one opinion, instigate him in many ways to death,
or recommend the nature of death to him, and he (i.e., that man) should die by that [means],
and [the monastic community] cannot live with him.

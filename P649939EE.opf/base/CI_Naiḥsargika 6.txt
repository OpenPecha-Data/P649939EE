6. Whatever monk, having approached an unrelated householder or householder's wife, should ask
for a robe, except at the right time, that is a niḥsargika-pāyāntika. Under those circumstances,
this is the right time: when a monk is one whose robe has been stolen. whose robe
has been destroyed. whose robe has been burned, whose robe has been washed away, whose robe
has been carried off [by wind]. This is the right time in this matter.

bowl when his [old] bowl, which is fit for use, has been repaired in less than five places,
[is guilty], in the obtaining of the bowl, [of) a niḥsargika-pāyāntika, That bowl should
be forfeited to the assembly of monks by that monk. That which is the last bowl in that
assembly of monks should be given to that monk, saying: “This [bowl] is for you, 0 monk.

gradually until it is entirely broken.” This is the proper course in this matter.

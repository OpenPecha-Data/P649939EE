dharma, thinking, “Just so, I will cause him to fall from the pure life”; and at a later
time, when he is being examined or not being examined, that legal question of his [is
determined to be] groundless, and the monk should stand fast because of hostility, saying,
“I spoke in hostility”; that is a saṃghāvaśeṣa.

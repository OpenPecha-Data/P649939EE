4. Whatever monk, unknowing and not understanding, should boast of having superhuman faculties,
sufficient knowledge and the specific spiritual realization of the nobles, and insight
and a state of comforts which are inexistent and unobtained [by him], saying, “I know this,
I see this”; and at a later time, the fallen [monk], having purity in view, being made
responsible or not being made responsible, should say, “O Venerable Ones, I said I know, I
see, [but, it was] worthless, vain, false speaking”; unless [spoken] because of pride, this
monk is pārājika, expelled.

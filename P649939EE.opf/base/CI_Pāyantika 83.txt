83. Whatever monk, when the half-monthly Prātimokṣa Sūtra is being recited, should say: “Just
now, O Venerable Ones, do I understand this dharma which is included in the Sūtra, occurs
in the Sutra, and comes up in the recitation”; and if the monks should know, with regard
to the Venerable One, that the Venerable One has previously sat in the Poṣadha ceremony two
or three times, not to say oftener, there is no freedom for the ignorant monk. Then [that
monk] who has fallen into offense should be dealt with according to Dharma, and further
remorse should be imposed [on him], saying, “For you, O Venerable One, this which has been
obtained improperly and not properly is unobtained and unacquired. You, when the half-monthly
Prātimokṣa Sūtra is being recited, do not listen respectfully, do not pay respect, do
not make supplication, do not meditate with a one-pointed mind, do not listen with an attentive
ear, and do not listen with the conviction of the entire mind. Therefore, O Venerable
One, because ofremorse, there is a pāyāntika.'

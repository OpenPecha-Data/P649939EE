9. Whatever monk, angry because of hostility, taking up something merely as a pretext for a
legal question connected with something contrary or other, should accuse a pure monk of a
pārājika dharma, thinking, “Just so, I will cause him to fall from the pure life”; and at
a later time, when he is being examined or not being examined, that legal question [is determined
to be connected with something else, that thing is used merely as a pretext pointing
to something [else], and the monk should stand fast in his hostility, saying, “I spoke
because of hostility”; that is a saṃghāvaśeṣa.

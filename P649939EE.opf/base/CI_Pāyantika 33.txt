things such as barley-gruel and meal, two or three bowls full may be accepted by those monks
if they wish. Should they accept in excess of that, that is a pāyāntika. Having accepted
two or three bowls full, and going outside the ārāma, [the bowls full] should be shared
by those monks with [other] monks, and it (i.e., the food) should be eaten by each. This
is the proper course in this matter.

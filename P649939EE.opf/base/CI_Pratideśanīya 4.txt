4. There are forest dwellings which are considered by the saṃgha to be doubtful, dangerous,
and fearful. Whatever monk, in such forest dwellings which are considered by the saṃgha to
be doubtful, dangerous, and fearful, being previously unawares, should 'chew or consume hard
food and soft food in the forest outside of the arama, that should be confessed in the
presence of the monks by that monk, saying: “Having fallen into an unwholesome position,
O Venerable Ones, I am blameworthy. Therefore, I confess that pratideśanīya dharma.” This
is a pratideśanīya dharma.

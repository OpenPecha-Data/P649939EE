11. If there are one, two, three, or many monk-comrades of a monk who is a speaker of disunion,
and should these monks say to those [other] monks, “Do not, O Venerable Ones, say anything
good or bad about this monk. Why? This monk, O Venerable Ones, speaks according to the
Dharma and according to the Vinaya, and taking up our wish and objective, obtains [them].
This monk speaks knowingly and not unknowingly, and that which pleases this monk also pleases
and seems good to us.” These monks [siding with the schism-maker] should be spoken to
thus by the monks: “Do not let the Venerable Ones speak this way. That monk does not speak
according to the Dharma and according to the Vinaya. [Do not say that that monk], taking
up our wish and objective, obtains [them]. [Do not say] that monk speaks knowingly and not
unknowingly, and that which pleases and seems good to that monk also seems good to you.
Also, O Venerable Ones, do not take delight in a schism in the saṃgha, Again, do not [allow]
a schism in the saṃgha to [provide] delight for the Venerable Ones. Let the Venerable
Ones come together with the saṃgha, for the saṃgha is harmonious, on friendly terms, without
dispute, and dwells in a happy condition under a one-pointed Dharma exposition, being one
like milk and water, demonstrating the Teaching of the Teacher. Do not, O Venerable One,
persist toward a division of the saṃgha. Abandon this form of speech which causes a division
in the saṃgha.” These [schismatic] monks should be examined and instructed a second and
a third time by the [other] monks for the abandonment of that course, and should they,
being examined and instructed a second and a third time, abandon that course, this is good.
If they should not abandon it, that is a saṃghāvaśeṣa,

1. Whatever monk should sit down with a woman, one with the other, in secret, on a concealed
seat suitable to have sexual intercourse, and if a trustworthy upāsikā should accuse [him]
of one or another of three dharmas: [either] with a pārājika, saṃghāvaśeṣa, or pāyāntika
dharma, that monk, admitting that he was so seated, should be dealt with according to one
or another of threedharmas: [either] a pārājika, saṃghāvaśeṣa, or pāyāntika dharma; or by
whichever dharma that trustworthy upasika should accuse that monk. So should that monk be
dealt with by this or that dharma. This is an aniyata.

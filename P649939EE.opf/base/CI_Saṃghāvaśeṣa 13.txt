13. If some monk here who is difficult to speak to, being spoken to by the monks in accordance
with the Dharma and in accordance with the Vinaya, concerning the moral precepts included
in the exposition and included in the Sūtras of the Sugata, makes himself one who is not
to be spoken to, saying, “Do not, O Venerable Ones, say anything to me, either good or bad,
and also I will not say anything good or bad to the Venerable Ones. Let the Venerable
Ones abstain from speaking to me, and also I will abstain from speaking to you”; that monk
should be spoken to thus by the monks: “You, o Venerable One, being spoken to by the monks
in accordance with the Dharma and in accordance with the Vinaya, concerning the moral precepts
included in the exposition and included in the Sūtras of the Sugata, make yourself
one who is not to be spoken to. Let the Venerable One make himself one who is to be spoken
to. Let the monks speak to the Venerable One in accordance with the Dharma and in accordance
with the Vinaya, and also let the Venerable One speak to the monks in accordance with
the Dharma and in accordance with the Vinaya, for thus, through mutual speech and through
mutual helping to eliminate faults, will the community of the Blessed One, the Tathāgata,
the Arhant, the Fully Enlightened One, be bound together. Do not let the Venerable One make
himself one who is not to be spoken to.” That monk should be spoken to thus by the monks.
If he should abandon that course, this is good. If he should not abandon it, he should be
examined and instructed a second and a third time for the abandonment of that [course].
Should he, being examined and instructed a second and a third time, abandon that course, this
is good.lfhe should not abandon it, that is a saṃghāvaśeṣa.

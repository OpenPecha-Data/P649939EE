1. Whatever monk, having accepted hard food or soft food, with his own hand, in the presence
of an unrelated nun who has wandered amongst the houses for alms food, should chew or consume
it, that should be confessed in the presence of the monks by that monk, going outside
the arama, saying: "Having fallen into an unwholesome position, O Venerable Ones, I am blameworthy.
Therefore, I confess that pratideśanīya dharma.” This is a pratideśanīya dharma.

2. Whatever monk should take from others what is not given, be it in a village or forest, in
a manner considered to be theft, and by such form of theft, a king or king's minister, having
seized him, would slay, bind, or banish him, saying, “O man, you are a thief, you are
a fool, you are confused, you are a robber”; should the monk take in this way what is not
given, this monk is pārājika, and [the monastic community] cannot live with him.

10. Whatever monk should proceed toward a division of a saṃgha which is harmonious, or having
taken up a legal question conducive to causing a schism, should persist in taking it up,
that monk should be spoken to thus by the monks: “The Venerable One should not proceed toward
a division of the saṃgha which is harmonious, or having taken up a legal question conducive
to causing a schism, persist in taking it up. Let the Venerable One come together with
the saṃgha, for the saṃgha is harmonious, united, on friendly terms, without dispute,
and dwells in a happy condition under a one-pointed Dharma exposition, being like milk and
water, demonstrating the Teaching”?” of the Teacher. Abandon, O Venerable One, such a course
which causes a schism in the saṃgha.” If that monk, being spoken to by the monks, should
abandon that course,". this is good. If he should not abandon it, he should be examined
and instructed a second and a third time for the abandonment of that course. Should he, being
examined and instructed a second and a third time, abandon that course, this is good.
If he should not abandon it, that is a saṃghāvaśeṣa.

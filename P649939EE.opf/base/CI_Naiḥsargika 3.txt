3. A robe accruing to a monk at the wrong time: when he has been provided with a [set of] robes,
and the kaṭhina ceremony has been suspended, may be accepted by that monk if he wishes.
Having accepted that robe, and making it up quickly, it should be worn if it is completed.
If it is not completed, that robe should be laid aside by that monk for a month at the
most when hope exists that he may complete the deficiency of the robe. Should he lay it aside
in excess of that, that is a niḥsargika-pāyāntika.

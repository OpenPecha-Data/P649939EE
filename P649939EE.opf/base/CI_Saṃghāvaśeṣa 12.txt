12. If many monks who are corrupters of families and practitioners of evil should dwell near
a certain village or town and the families corrupted by these [monks] should be seen, heard,
or known of, these monks should be spoken to thus by the monks: “The Venerable Ones are
corrupters of families and practitioners of evil, and the families corrupted by you are
seen, heard, and known of. Depart, O Venerable Ones, from this āvāsa, You have lived here
long enough!” If these [evil] monks should say to those [other] monks: “The monks, O Venerable
Ones, are followers of desire, followers of malice, followers of delusion, and followers
of fear. They banish some monks because of faults such as these, but do not banish some
[other] monks”; the monks should be spoken to thus: “Do not, O Venerable Ones, speak in
this way; that some monks are followers of desire, followers of malice, followers of delusion,
and followers of fear; that they banish some monks because of faults such as these, but
do not banish some [other] monks. Why? These monks are not followers of desire, followers
of malice, followers of delusion, and followers of fear, but you Venerable Ones are indeed
corrupters of families and practitioners of evil. The families corrupted by you are seen
and heard, and your evil practices are seen, heard, and known of. [You] monks, O Venerable
Ones, are followers of desire, followers of malice, followers of delusion, and followers
of fear. Abandon this form of speech.” These [evil] monks should be spoken to thus by the
monks. If they should abandon it, this is good. If they should not abandon if, they should
be examined and instructed a second and a third time for the abandonment [of that course].
Should they, being examined and instructed a second and a third time, abandon [that course],
this is good. If they should not abandon it, that is a saṃghāvaśeṣa.

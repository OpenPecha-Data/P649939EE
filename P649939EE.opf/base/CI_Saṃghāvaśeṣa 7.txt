7. When a monk is having a large vihāra built, with a donor and intended for the saṃgha, monks
should he brought by that monk for viewing of the site. Hence, the site should be viewed
by those monks who are brought to not involve slaughter and be food for roaming about. If
the monk is having a large vihāra built, which has a donor and is intended for the saṃgha,
on a site which is not good for roaming about, or should he not bring the monks for viewing
of the site, that is a saṃghāvaśeṣa.

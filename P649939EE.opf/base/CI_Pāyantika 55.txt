55. Whatever monk should say: “As I understand the Dharma taught by the Blessed One, indulgences
in these which have been declared by the Blessed One to be obstructive conditions are
not sufficient for a hindrance”; that monk should be spoken to thus by the monks: “Do not,
O Venerable One, speak thus: 'As I understand the Dharma taught by the Blessed One, indulgences
in these which have been declared by the Blessed One to be obstructive conditions
are not sufficient for a hindrance.' Do not speak [this] about the Blessed One. False accusation
against the Blessed One is not good, and also the Blessed One has not said that. The
obstructive conditions, O Venerable One, have been declared by the Blessed One in many ways
to really be obstructive, and indulgences [in them] are sufficient for a hindrance, Abandon
such an evil view, O Venerable One.” If that monk, being spoken to by the monks, should
abandon that course, this is good. If he should not abandon it, he should be examined
and instructed two or three times for the abandonment of that course. Being examined and instructed
two or three times, should he abandon that course, this is good. If he should not
abandon it, that is a pāyāntika.

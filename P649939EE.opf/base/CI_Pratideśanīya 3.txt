3. There are families which have been considered by formal declaration to be undergoing training.
Whatever monk, having been previously uninvited and having accepted hard food and soft
food amongst such families which have been considered by formal declaration of the saṃgha
to be undergoing training, should chew or consume it, that should be confessed in the presence
of the monks by that monk, going outside the arama, saying: “Having fallen into an
unwholesome position, I confess that pratideśanīya dharma.” This is a pratideśanīya dharma.

27. When many monks are [spending] the rains on beds and seats in forests which are held to
be doubtful, [full of] various fears, and abundantly dangerous, one or another robe of the
three robes may be laid aside, inside a house, by the forest [dwelling] monk, if be wishes.
Should there be any reason such as that for a forest [dwelling] monk to go outside the
sima, that forest [dwelling] monk may stay away, outside the sima, from that robe for six
nights at the most. Should he stay away in excess of that, that is a niḥsargika-pāyāntika.

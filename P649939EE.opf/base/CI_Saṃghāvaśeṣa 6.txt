6. When a monk, by begging himself, is having a hut built, having no donor and intended for
himself, the hut should be built according to measure. This is the measure for the hut: in
length, twelve spans of the Sugata-span in width, seven spans inside. Monks should be brought
by that monk for viewing the site. The site should be viewed by those monks who are brought
to not involve slaughter and be good for roaming about. If the monk should have the
hut built, for which he begged himself, having no donor and intended for himself, on a site
which involves destruction and is not good for roaming about, or should he not bring monks
to view the site, or should he exceed the measure on a site which has not been viewed
by the, monks who were not brought, that is a saṃghāvaśeṣa.

7. When a monk whose robe has been stolen, whose robe has been destroyed. whose robe has been
burned, whose robe has been washed away, or whose robe has been carried off [by wind], having
approached an unrelated householder or householder's wife, should ask for a robe, if
that faithful [wife] or Brāhmaṇa householder should offer that one excessively, regarding
[material for] many robes, [material for] an inner and upper robe at the most should be accepted
from that one by the monk, if he wishes. Should he accept in excess of that, that
is a niḥsargika-pāyāntika.

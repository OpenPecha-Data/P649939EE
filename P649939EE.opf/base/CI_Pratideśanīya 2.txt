2. Many monks eat, having been invited amongst families. If a nun should stand there indicating,
“Give soft food here; give boiled rice; give sauce”; that nun should be spoken to thus
by the monks: “You should wait for a moment, Sister, until the monks eat.” If even one monk
should not speak to remove that nun, that should be confessed in the presence of the monks
by all those monks, going outside the arama, saying: “Having fallen into an unwholesome
position, O Venerable Ones, we are blameworthy. Therefore, we confess that pratideśanīya
dharma.” This is a pratideśanīya dharma.

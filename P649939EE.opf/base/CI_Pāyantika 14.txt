14. Whatever monk, placing down or throwing down a cushion, couch, chair, or four-cornered pillow
in an open space belonging to the saṃgha, should then, neither removing nor having it
removed, go away without asking a competent monk [for permission], except when there is
a reason, that is a pāyāntika.

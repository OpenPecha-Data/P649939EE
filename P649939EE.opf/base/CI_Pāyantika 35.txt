35. Whatever monk, in trying to find a weak point in his fellow monk, should knowingly invite
a monk who has eaten and finished, be it hard food or soft food, not invoking the principle
of leftover food, saying: “Eat this, O Venerable One, enjoy this”; thinking that this
monk will eat since he is searching for such taste, making a cause for him to do this, that
is a pāyāntika [for the one who instigates this situation].
